# MCRCodingTest

Running MCRApi
 1. On MCRApi path run the DBScript.sql on yout SQL Server
 2. On application path, modify the "Startup.cs" find the "connString" and change the connection string based on what is installed on your machine.
 3. Run the application using vscode or dotnet script.

Note that the application doesn't have a login yet, cause there's an issue on implementing webtokens on the "MCRApi" possibly due to compatibility issue cause I'm using a macos, not really sure XD, but I got a sort of code already there inregards impelementing web tokens for evaluating purposes. 

Running MCRReactjs
 1. Make sure that you have "npm" installed on your local machine.
 2. On application path run "npm install".
 3. Once dependencies are now installed, run "npm start".
